# OpenStack Fuel Plugins workshop

A workshop of sharing and live demo on how to build OpenStack Fuel Plugins.

OpenStack Fuel is a deployment and management tool for OpenStack, Fuel provide a SDK/API to allow developers adding extensions of a OpenStack Fuel Cluster to expose configuration, operatation interfaces to end user.

In this workshop, OpenStack Fuel arch and concepts, deep dives and dev tips were introduced. A sample Fuel Plugin was created to live demo it from scratch, where I created a Fuel Plugin to enable the nova-docker plugin for OpenStack Nova, to enable a OpenStack Cluster spawning Docker Instances with Nova API.
