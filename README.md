### Openstack Basic
Training Sessions for newbies on OpenStack for my team.

The target audience were Telco. Engineers who would like to get into NFV/ Cloud/ OpenStack fields, and it worked :-). 

Years later, I used this slide for newcomers of my new team, a Cloud Infra. development department.

### Python Bootcamp

Training Sessions for newbies on Python in my previous (non R&D) orgnization, check it out [here](https://github.com/wey-gu/workshops/tree/master/01-Python-Bootcamp).

I was new to Python at that time, while to have chances to advocate and help people with tech/ magics is really where my passion lies on!

Three sections:

- Create a CLI tool, which is easier for guys like me to create something before knowing how to code anything
- Create a Tool with webUI, after this, many of my friends created some tools for their team, I believe they will continue building things with those accomplishment in first shot!
- Create a Blockchain, after creating something useful, let's do some buzz thing ;-)

### How to build OpenStack Fuel Plugins

A workshop of sharing and live demo on how to build OpenStack Fuel Plugins.

OpenStack Fuel is a deployment and management tool for OpenStack, Fuel provide a SDK/API to allow developers adding extensions of a OpenStack Fuel Cluster to expose configuration, operatation interfaces to end user.

In this workshop, OpenStack Fuel arch and concepts, deep dives and dev tips were introduced. A sample Fuel Plugin was created to live demo it from scratch, where I created a Fuel Plugin to enable the nova-docker plugin for OpenStack Nova, to enable a OpenStack Cluster spawning Docker Instances with Nova API.
